After all, haven't we been told our whole lives that there is no pain on earth that compares with that of giving birth? There has been so much talk of the pain associated with natural childbirth, in fact, that millions of mothers have been scared beyond reason at even considering this means of delivering their new babies into the world.<br><br>It's time for women to rethink the fear of delivering their babies without drugs. Yes, childbirth – whether medicated or unmediated – is painful. However, there are some distinct advantages to delivering naturally. <br><br>Here are just a few of the advantages of natural birth for you to consider:<br><h2>Increased Clarity</h2><br>The pharmaceutical pain killers used during child birth leave women groggy, disconnected and not really in the moment, as it were. It's sad, but many women report that these drug induced hazes have actually kept them from remembering the birth process altogether. There are few moments in life that are truly once in a lifetime. And the birth of your baby is definitely one of them. When you deliver without the use of drugs, you will have increased clarity and connectedness with your baby throughout the delivery. <br><h2>Faster Delivery</h2><br>The drugs that are used in epidurals do help to kill the pain, but they can also greatly increase the overall time that you are in labor. Experts agree that women who have not been medicated are better able to push effectively during labor, and more often than not, deliver their babies quicker. Yes, you may feel more pain without the drugs, but you are more likely to be done with the process and enjoying time with your baby faster, when you choose natural child birth.<br><h2>Mom is in Control</h2><br>When you get hooked up to an epidural, you immediately give up a fair bit of control over the birthing process. You are stuck with an IV and very little control over your legs. When you choose natural child birth, you are not reliant on an IV, and can decide to get up and walk should you so choose. Walking can help to speed up delivery, and it's much easier to do when you are not encumbered by pain killing drugs.<br><h2>Better for Baby</h2><br>The bottom line is that natural child birth is better for your baby's well being. When you forgo the epidural, your baby has the advantage of entering the world without the haziness or confusion associated with the use of drugs. We all want to give our children every advantage that we can; skipping the epidural allows you to give your baby a distinct advantage from the very first moment they enter this world.<br>Keep these advantages in mind as you decide on the child birth method that is best for you and your growing family.<br><br><br><br><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d6547.714661533232!2d-82.375416!3d34.859812000000005!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x88582e3b798fb6f5%3A0x1c4b6f7cceb01090!2s1622+E+North+St%2C+Greenville%2C+SC+29607!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1521289630262" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><a href="https://goo.gl/ZiLfQN">natural birth in Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/j6W3R6">natural water birth Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/Ukhp4m">natural birth Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/1mFNwP">natural home birth Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/MSajdY">natural childbirth Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/y5sw1u">natural home water birth Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/eXYcCT">natural water birth delivery Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/h8FT7X">natural water birth in  Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/P5yQuz">natural delivery birth in water Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/V1tNHc">natural water birth information Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/7dDXgV">natural birthing options Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/RDPabk">midwife natural delivery Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/yeDarr">midwife natural birth Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/kguot3">a natural midwife Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/nEyYeh">natural homebirth midwife Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/Riqzb1">natural childbirth Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/wtSsWF">natural midwife services Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/K2QBUb">all natural birth Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/Z8bejv">natural childbirth at home Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/Y3v2E8">natural labor and delivery Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/Qs4bWc">natural pregnancy and birth Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/WpF7eJ">natural midwife water birth Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/8pXesq">normal delivery in water Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/ShQWvu">natural childbirth the bradley way Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/sYH7b4">natural water pregnancy delivery Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/uM2sqb">baby birth delivery Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/9ASyjr">natural baby birth Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/jqhjZA">giving natural birth in a birthing pool Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/exBx5Z">having a baby at home Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/LKyohA">natural water birth first baby Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/3u8aE9">preparing for natural birth Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/Ps6uHT">natural birth information Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/keeR4b">natural birth midwife Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/Mo57ga">having a baby naturally in water Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/11Hch6">how to give birth naturally Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/x5K2xd">natural home birth water birth Greenville</a><br> <a href="https://goo.gl/8PJH7b">natural birth delivery Greenville</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
